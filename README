*********************************Language Model*************************************

This program takes input text as a “model,” and generates new text based on that
model.

Specifically, the program uses the model to learn the frequency of specific
words and their relative placement next to other words. It is best to leave out
punctuation from the paragraph model; any punctuation will be read as an extension
of the attached word. The program then computes probabilities of where a word will
appear, and generates new text.
